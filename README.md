## SUMMARY

This project is created using create-react-app. This is my first personal mini project after completing ReactJS course on Udemy.

## WHAT DOES IT DO

This simple web app is to keep track of the shows that people watch. Often people may forget what episode did they stopped at. This can help them keep track of it.

## Functionality

User can sign in using their Google account.

User can add show title, total episode the show has and the episode they are currently on. They can even add in pictures of the show (only in jpeg or png format).

The next-episode button will open a modal and asked if they have watched the episode. If yes, the episode count increases.

They can even edit by clicking on the show.

And finally, this app is deployed using Heroku.

## Build

This web app is made using firebase for database, storage and authentication.

SCSS is used for styling of the app.
